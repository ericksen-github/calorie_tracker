## Weight and Calorie Tracker

This app is my first personal project that I'm using to develop skills beyond basic online coursework. It uses Chart.js to plot line graphs of user input data about weight, calories, exercise, and protein, and it allows users to switch between individual graphs. All input data is stored locally.
